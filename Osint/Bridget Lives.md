This bridge looks very unique and is probably reverse image searchable.

We are now sent to the Singapore river, but there are still many bridges that look the same.

We quickly located Robertson Bridge after matching the general contour of the river, and the circular stairs at the top. From here, we are obviously looking down at the bridge through the window of a tall building. We must be in ```Four Points by Sheraton```.
