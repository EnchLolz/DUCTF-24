>The MAG cipher was a fast stream cipher algorithm submitted to the eSTREAM project of the eCRYPT network. It was not selected for consideration in the second phase, as further cryptanalysis revealed a number of vulnerabilities including a distinguisher, partial-key recovery and in some variants a full key recovery. This challenge implements a weaker version of the MAG cipher with some security features removed.

>Funnily enough, the wikipedia article got deleted just as I was writing this challenge due to a lack of notability.
