>Did MC Fat Monke just drop a new track????? ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€

### Solution

Who is MC Fat Monke? Let's google him!

Looks like we found his new track. After listening to the most banger track on loop for 30 mins, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmhn3IMLQyM, I realized that I needed to find a flag :skull:.

After trying a bunch of random stuff, audio analysis, yt video meta data, etc, and rewatching it over and over again, I saw something interesting at [2:34](https://youtu.be/jmhn3IMLQyM?t=154), a computer that said free flag :0

There is also a link at the top of this fake webpage:
https://average-primate-th.wixsite.com/mc-fat-monke-appreci

Carefully transcribing it, and visiting the website yields the flag.
